# Cadmus
Based on https://pinky-lang.org/

"Pinky is the perfect toy language for those who are just starting their journey into learning about compilers & interpreters. The language is ridiculously small, allowing students to really focus on compiler concepts instead of hipster language features."

I decided to learn how to build compilers/interpreters for fun. This project is based on Pinky but will probably deviate heavily in terms of grammer/syntax maybe even functionality.
